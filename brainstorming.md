# Brainstorming

The main focus of the mod is to allow syncing train schedules between multiple trains

- Add/remove "networks"
- Add/remove trains from each network
  - Dropdown
- Sync schedules with all trains in the network, and train colors with like-trains in each network
- Changes made to one train in the network will affect all trains
  - Temporary stops are excluded from this logic (configurable?)

## GUI

- GUI will not be a standalone thing, it'll pop up when you open a train's GUI
- See a list of all other trains on the network, jump to them
  - Cameras / minimaps of each train?
- Add / remove networks
- Change which network this train belongs to

## Selection tool?

- Perhaps add a selection tool to quickly add trains to a specific network?

## Feedback

- Hovering a train carriage will tell you which network it's a part of
  - Does not work in map view
    - Interface request / add it myself (source access)
-

## Priorities

- [ ] Create / destroy networks
- [ ] Add / remove a train from a network
- [ ] Sync schedules
- [ ] Sync colors
