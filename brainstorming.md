# Brainstorming

The main focus of the mod is to allow syncing train schedules between multiple trains

- Add/remove "groups"
- Add/remove trains from each group
  - Dropdown
- Sync schedules with all trains in the group, and train colors with like-trains in each group
- Changes made to one train in the group will affect all trains
  - Temporary stops are excluded from this logic (configurable?)

## GUI

- GUI will be attached to the train GUI
- See a list of all other trains on the group, jump to them
  - Cameras / minimaps of each train?
- Add / remove groups
- Change which group this train belongs to

## Selection tool?

- Perhaps add a selection tool to quickly add trains to a specific group?

## Feedback

- Hovering a train carriage will tell you which group it's a part of
  - Does not work in map view
    - Interface request / add it myself (source access)
-

## Priorities

- [ ] Create / destroy groups
- [ ] Add / remove a train from a group
- [ ] Sync schedules
- [ ] Sync colors
